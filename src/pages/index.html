      <h4>Butterfly Man (in production)</h4>
      <p>At 83, Dr. Lincoln P. Brower has studied Monarch butterflies longer than anyone on the planet. He first became enamored of butterflies as a five-year-old in New Jersey and later by Monarchs when he learned they don’t taste good to predators. His famous “Barfing Bluejay” photo proved their unpleasant taste to predators and always gets a chuckle when shared in presentations.</p>

      <p>A screening tour of Maine brought the film to 25 cities and towns around the state—many of which had rarely hosted theatrical screenings of a documentary before.</p>

          <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <p>Jason is a comic fictional character created and portrayed by American comedian Paul Reubens. He is best known for his two television series and film series during the 1980s. The childlike Pee-wee Herman character developed as a stage act that quickly led to an HBO special in 1981. As the stage performance gained further popularity, Reubens took the character to motion picture with Pee-wee's Big Adventure in 1985, toning down the adult innuendo for the appeal of children. This paved the way for Pee-wee's Playhouse, an Emmy Award-winning children's series that ran on CBS from 1986 to 1991. Another film, Big Top Pee-wee, was released in 1988.</p>
